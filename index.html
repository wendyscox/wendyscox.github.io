            Hello! I’m Wendy, a Rollins graduate, a Disney Passholder, and a cosplayer. I'm a Florida native, born in Tallahassee. 
            I have an Etsy shop called, Chic and Geeks. It's an online store where I sell mainly Star Wars products. The products 
            range from Rebel Legion approved costumes for cosplayers, assortment of Star Wars themed seatbelts, and the geek dog bows. 
        <br>
            Sewing costumes blossomed from my favorite holiday, Halloween. Every year Disney has a special event, Mickey’s Not So 
            Scary Halloween Party. You can trick or treat and wear costumes in the park! Instead of spending money on a cheap bagged 
            costume, I made them. My friends needed help with their outfits, so I would make theirs too. Each year, the costumes kept 
            getting more elaborate. After building a self-taught foundation, I went on to volunteer as a seamstress at Theatre Downtown in Orlando.
        <br>    
            I used to work in a restaurant as cook. During the summers, the restaurant made lunch for the Orlando Magic Summer Camp 
            program. I was asked to make Patrick Ewings Hall of Fame cake. I just started baking cakes on the side as a hobby. 
            It was the time Ace of Cakes was on TV. I would watch how they created things, and said, I can do that too. The request 
            was daunting, but I knew I had to say yes to this project.  I’m finding a lot of my highlights in life came from taking 
            risks and doing things out of my comfort zone. Another example is my cousin had a friend who needed a costume for the 
            Eukanuba mascot to be featured at the AKC dog show. The stores don’t make mascot patterns, so I learned quickly and as 
            Tim Gunn says, “make it work”.  
        <br>    
            Currently, I paint a prop moon that is used in "Professor Moriarty's Gameroom" located at The Great Escape Room in Orlando.
            Also, I'm a costumer for Fringe, Shakespeare's Ghostbusters.
